    <h2>The "based" logic</h2>
    <h3>Or how this problem was broken down, step by step adding a little bit more to the complexity to the problem</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This can seem overwhelming, so we started with the simpliest part, the I, which works up to 4(1 = I, 2 = II, 3 = III)
            ,I's only = 1 so we only need to take away 1 at a time.
        </li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with when I's failed to work, at 4, which is IV, since that has a value of 4 we subtract 4 each time.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with when IV cannot be used at 5 which is V, so repeat the process again subtracting 5 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with when V cannot be used at 9 which is IX, so repeat the process again subtracting 9 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with when IX cannot be used at 10 which is X, so repeat the process again subtracting 10 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 40 which is XL, so repeat the process again subtracting 40 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 50 which is L, so repeat the process again subtracting 50 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 90 which is XC, so repeat the process again subtracting 90 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 100 which is C, so repeat the process again subtracting 100 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 500 which is D, so repeat the process again subtracting 500 etc.</li>
        <li>Then we had to deal with 1000 which is M, so repeat the process again subtracting 1000 etc.</li>
    </ul>
